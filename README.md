Salutations,

I am Olu, an enthusiast of Data Analysis. Presently, I am immersed in mastering SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python. I eagerly seeking collaborative projects to enhance my skills and insights in data analytics.

I began my start in data analytics at the beginning of 2023, and it's been a very gratifying feeling. 

The most intruiging part of data to me is able to find such interesting insights and create possible solutions through visualizations. 

My biggest areas of in data are working with healthcare data, crime data, or anything civic tech. 

I'm hoping to contribute significant impact and assistance to any company i work with now and in the future. The future will need lots of objective, non-biased analysts to bring about progress and I believe i'm one of them!

Warm regards,
Olu
